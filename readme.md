## No More Twitter Topics

This Chrome extension automatically detects suggested topics and hides them for you:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/no-more-twitter-topics/phniakkdlfjdpdflfhbnlbnocpcbolhk

An option allows you to completely hide them on your screen, as if they never appeared (if disabled, they will appear as if you automatically hit the X button to mark them as not interested only)
